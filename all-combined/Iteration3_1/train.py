### Observations
# ----------------
# Adding to the Observations from train.py from Iteration 1. The Gold Agent playing better moves
# and the probability of making random good moves being less.  Below Changes are made.
# A convoluted Network is included.
#  - Epsilon-Greedy method is changed to be active during the first half of the games in the Training Iterations.
#  - Since the Probability of getting rewards are pretty less, inverting the last move of every loss from Iron Agent to 
#       the training data.
#  - If random move is invalid during epsilon Phase, A negative reward is added and also, another random move is made, until
#    The game moves forward, until draw or loss.  
#
